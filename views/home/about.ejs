        <h3>About WoodMoney</h3>
        <div>
            <p>The WoodMoney method of ranking NHL players into 3 tiers of Quality got its genesis in the comments section of the venerable Oilers blog lowetide.ca in 2015.</p>

            <p>Lowetide posters Woodguy and GMoney would pour through the shift data of games noting how coaches matched up players and how those matchups affect their results.  They were dissatisfied with the most common tools to determine Quality of Competition and decided to figure out a new method.</p>

            <p>The WoodMoney QoC approach is an ice-level matchup-based statistic intended to <i>estimate</i> QoC in a useful and understandable way. </p>

            <p>To do so, we use player tiers that *approximate* (with as much objectivity as we can) what *most* people would consider “Elite” and “Gritensity” players. (your mileage will vary but generally won't change the results much!)</p>

            <p>While a considerable amount of thought and rigour has gone into every step along the way (not to mention a whole hell of a lot of work), everything about this approach prioritizes pragmatism and especially usability over technical purity.</p>
